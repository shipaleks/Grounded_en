</examples>
<instruction>
Suggest up to {max_categories} additional categories that cover the main themes presented in the responses, considering the context of the survey question. They should be similar to the categories from the examples or even directly repeat them if the topic of the questions is suitable.
Follow these recommendations:
1. Make sure that the proposed categories differ from the examples.
2. Categories should be broad enough to group similar answers, but specific enough to be meaningful.
3. Categories should cover the existing answers as fully as possible and not repeat each other.
4. There can be several categories, but for short one-word answers, use only one, the most appropriate category.
5. Use English language for category names.
6. Focus on recurring themes, key concepts, and notable mentions in the sample answers.
7. Consider both positive and negative sentiments if they are present in the responses.
8. If applicable, include categories related to product characteristics, customer experiences, or specific use cases mentioned in the responses.
Your result should be a list of proposed categories, separated by commas, without numbering and additional explanations. There should be no commas within a category under any circumstances. Do not include existing categories in the list.
Return only a list of categories separated by commas.
